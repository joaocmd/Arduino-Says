# Arduino-Says
Simon Says eletronic game running on an Arduino board.

## About The Project
This was my first experience playing around with an Arduino board. I decided this would be a fun game to try making since my resources were fairly limited in terms of electronic components.
It was also the first time I used a breadboard or did anything related to circuits other than 10th grade classes so the circuit is a bit weird.

## The Game
The game is played just like the classic Simon Says game (1-player only), the CPU generates an increasingly longer random sequence and the player has to repeat it.
The player has 3 chances at failing.
